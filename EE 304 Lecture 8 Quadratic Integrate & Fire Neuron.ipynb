    "- We studied the impact of transistor mismatch on our leaky membrane silicon circuit\n",
    "    - a current-mode, log-domain design that uses subthreshold MOS transistors  \n",
    "- We found that threshold votages of \"identical\" transistors are normally distributed \n",
    "    - The standard-deviation is inversely proportional to the square-root of the channel's area\n",
    "    - This dependence arises from fluctuations in dopant-ion counts from one transistor to another \n",
    "- We found that current-gains of \"identical\" transistors are lognormally distributed\n",
    "    - The normal threshold voltage distribution is passed through the voltage-to-current function\n",
    "    - This function is exponential subthreshold and quadratic above-threshold\n",
    "    - Hence, subtheshold currents are lognormally distributed\n",
    "    - And so is current-gain--the ratio of one transistor's current to another \n",
    "- We rederived the dimensionless model for our leaky membrane silicon circuit \n",
    "    - This time, we included transistor mismatch\n",
    "    - The dimensionless input current was:\n",
    "        - multiplied by the product of two transistors' current gains\n",
    "        - and divided by the product of two more transitors' current gains\n",
    "    - Thus, the dimensionless model's current-gain also was lognormally distributed\n",
